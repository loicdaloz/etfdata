Data Analysis on ETFs


This repository showcases my work related to data analysis of ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). As an aspiring data analyst in the finance industry, I have conducted extensive research and analysis of various ETFs, including their historical performance, risk and return ratios, and market trends.

The code and data included in this repository demonstrate my proficiency in various programming languages and tools commonly used in data analysis, including Python, R, Excel, and SQL. I have also included visualizations and insights derived from my analyses to showcase my ability to communicate complex data in a clear and concise manner.

I am excited to continue building my skills and knowledge in data analysis and would be thrilled to discuss any opportunities to work in this field with potential employers. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or feedback on my work.
